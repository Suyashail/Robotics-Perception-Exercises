## Week 1
The exercise for this week is to implement a Dolly Zoom Effect used by filmmakers to create a sensation of vertigo, a “falling-away-from-oneself feeling”. The effect keeps the size of an object of interests constant in the image, while making the foreground and background objects appear larger or smaller by adjusting focal length and moving the camera. This effect was first used in the movie Vertigo directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock.

## Week 2

	
## Week 3
The exercise for this week is to use tracking and pose estimation to implement a simple augmented reality application. There will be two steps to this process. First,
we will use a KLT tracker to get the position of corners across different frames. Then we will use homography estimation to compute the 3D pose of a set of 4 points in the
world. A 3D cube will be projected onto the image space using projective transformations.

## Week 4


## Tools
To run this project, you will need MATLAB. The code is written in MATLAB-R2018b but should be compatible with all recent versions.
