## Week 1
The exercise for this week is to implement a Dolly Zoom Effect used by filmmakers to create a sensation of vertigo, a “falling-away-from-oneself feeling”. The effect keeps the size of an object of interests constant in the image, while making the foreground and background objects appear larger or smaller by adjusting focal length and moving the camera. This effect was first used in the movie Vertigo directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock.
